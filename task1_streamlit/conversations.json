Essentially, they're computer programs that can understand natural language input from the user and generate appropriate responses in a humanlike way. Chatbots are typically used for tasks like customer service automation or information retrieval but have evolved into more complex systems capable of engaging users as real people would do on social media platforms, online retail websites, virtual assistants (Alexa/Siri), and so forth."}]]
